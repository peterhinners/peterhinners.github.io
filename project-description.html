      <p>First foray into javascript and requestAnimationFrame land. A simple javascript/html game completed in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. First attempt at collision detection. Originally had it so the cheese moved as well, but resulted in choppy, unrealistic movement. Canvas resizes dynamically. </p>

      <p>My brother's idea. A mobile-friendly Rails & jQuery app with the idea to incorporate Google Adsense at some point. Allows users to share via Facebook or Twitter an image of their favorite cat. Most challenging part was hacking around Facebook's Share functionality. It typically only allows you to share a single image for a given website, but we wanted users to be able to share an image of their favorite particular cat. Got it to work after some tinkering. Rails, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS.
