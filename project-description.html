            <p>I worked on this app for my 8 day final project at Dev Bootcamp. The app is designed to gather disparate charities together in one location to enable users to more easily donate to charities. It imports charity Amazon wishlists in real time, and offers full user & charity login/logout/profile capability. The site was built with Javascript, jQuery, Ruby, Rails, AJAX, Semantic, HTML5, & CSS3.</p>

            <p>A simple javascript/html game and my first foray into javascript. Completed in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. First attempt at collision detection. Originally had it so the cheese moved as well, but resulted in choppy, unrealistic movement. Canvas resizes dynamically. </p>

            <p>My brother's idea, implemented by me. The idea being to incorporate Google Adsense at some point. Most challenging part was hacking around Facebook's Share functionality... It typically only allows you to share a single image for a given website, but we wanted the users to be able to share an image of their favorite particular cat. Got it to work the way we wanted after some tinkering.</p>
