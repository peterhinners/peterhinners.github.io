            <p>A simple javascript/html game and my first foray into javascript. Completed in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. First attempt at collision detection. Originally had it so the cheese moved as well, but resulted in choppy, unrealistic movement. Canvas resizes dynamically. </p>

            <p>My brother's idea, implemented by me. The idea being to incorporate Google Adsense at some point. Most challenging part was hacking around Facebook's Share functionality... It typically only allows you to share a single image for a given website, but we wanted the users to be able to share an image of their favorite particular cat. Got it to work the way we wanted after some tinkering.</p>
