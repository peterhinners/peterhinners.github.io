    <h4>Asking Good Questions<br>April 5th, 2015</h4>
    
    <p>This blog is short look at some helpful ways to make sure we're asking "good" questions...
    </p>

    

    

<p>People have actually written on this topic before, and so rather than re-invent the wheel, I will highlight some of the most common themes that people recognize as being good habits to get into when asking questions.
</p>


<p>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. That is pretty much the gist of what people advise on this topic, boiled down to a familiar adage. Would you want to be facing a question that is ambiguous? Would you want to try and answer a question that is poorly worded? How about a question where you're not even really sure what the question is? Well, of course you wouldn't, so we need to make sure we're not putting people in that same scenario when we ask questions. </p>




<p>Another rule of thumb is to make sure the context of your question is clear. If it's a coding question, for example, make sure the reader knows which language you're talking about, and what platform you're working on. We also want to make sure we're actually asking a question and not just making a statement, which can happen surprisingly often, especially in the coding world. </p>

<p> One final thought is to make every reasonable effort to make sure the question (and/or example) is in a readable, clear, and concise format. Verbosity is rarely appreciated, and less in the programming world. It often helps to include a summary of the question at the end as well, to give added structure and to recap for the reader.</p>
