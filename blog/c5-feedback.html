    <h4>Pairing & Feedback<br>March 8th, 2015</h4>
    <p>Pairing and feedback are integral parts to the entire Dev Bootcamp experience and something we do on a weekly (sometimes daily) basis.
</p>
    <p>Pairing with others can be both rewarding and occasionally frustrating, depending on your learning tendencies. I know for myself that much of the time when I'm producing the most amount of usable, working code, it's the result of going down rabbit holes on my own, and looking at things from different perspectives, often through trial and error. I enjoy doing this with a partner in real time as well, and pairing provides an optimal setting for taking in new perspectives -- from your partner!

    </p>

    <p>Feedback is another big part of the DBC curriculum. As an example, each week we write detailed feedback three times -- on two of our peer-to-peer pairing sessions, as well as the guided pairing session. In addition, we are required to rate at least 7 pieces of anonymous feedback given to other (anonymous) students.</p>


    <p>In addition, DBC believes that effective feedback is generally "A.S.K." Actionable, Specific, and Kind. Having these guidelines is helpful, especially with regard to the Actionable part, as it's generally a little easier to be Kind and Specific, but sometimes a bit more challenging to find actual Actionable steps that could be taken in the future to promote a better pairing session. </p>
