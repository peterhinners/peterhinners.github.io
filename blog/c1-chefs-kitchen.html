      Wow, cool video. I'm encouraged after seeing this video with Shereef. I like how he talks about a couple fears that folks tend to have, and I can definitely say that one of my fears is what Shereef mentions when he says that some people are scared that they will not be as smart as their cohorts. That's me! :-) So it's encouraging to hear him say that we're not alone in having that fear, that it almost comes with the territory.

        I also like how Shereef mentions that DBC is still very much a working experiment. I think that's pretty sweet that he feels comfortable admitting that -- there's something winsome and endearing about that. I guess hearing that also makes you feel more empowered, that you will have actual, valuable input to a system that's still growing and evolving. I'm very excited to be a part of this, and I want to be a chef, not a consumer! ;-)
