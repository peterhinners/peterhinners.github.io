    <h4>The Chef's Kitchen<br>January 18th, 2015</h4>

      I'm encouraged after seeing this video with Shereef. I like how he talks about a couple fears that folks tend to have upon entering Dev Bootcamp, and I can definitely relate to those. Also good to hear him say that we're not alone in having those fears, that it almost comes with the territory.

        I also like how Shereef mentions that DBC is still very much a working experiment. I think that's pretty sweet that he feels comfortable admitting that -- there's something winsome and endearing about that. I guess hearing that also makes you feel more empowered, that you will have actual, valuable input to a system that's still growing and evolving. I'm very excited to be a part of this, and I want to be a chef, not a consumer! ;-)
