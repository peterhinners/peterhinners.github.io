We spent [2] hours on this challenge.

It was great pairing with Josh on this GPS. Josh is super easy to work with, and I think we were both able to bounce ideas off each other while taking turns driving and navigating. We reconvened again the next day to add some additional CSS touches.

        <h4>What is pair programming?</h4>
        <p>
            Pair programming is when two or more programmers work in unison to create a finished product. Contrary to the popular lone programmer stereotype, pair programming is actually increasingly seen in the workplace as well.
        </p>
        <h4>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>
        <p>
            Pair programming is important to DBC because they want to prepare us for real-world situations, which commonly include peer programming. It would also prepare students for remote work situations as well as foster empathy engineering best practices.
        </p>
        <h4>Compare Driver and Navigator</h4>
        <p>
            In peer programming the driver is doing most of the typing/coding while the navigator fascilitates the flow of logic.
