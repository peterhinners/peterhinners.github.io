      Wow, cool video. I'm encouraged after seeing this video with Shereef. I like how he talks about a couple fears that folks tend to have, and I can definitely say that one of my fears is what Shereef mentions when he says that some people are scared that they will not be as smart as their cohorts. That's me! :-) So it's encouraging to hear him say that we're not alone in having that fear, that it almost comes with the territory.

    </p>
    <p>
        I also like how Shereef mentions that DBC is still very much a working experiment. I think that's pretty sweet that he feels comfortable admitting that -- there's something winsome and endearing about that. I guess hearing that also makes you feel more empowered, that you will have actual, valuable input to a system that's still growing and evolving. I'm very excited to be a part of this, and I want to be a chef, not a consumer! ;-)

  <td> <h1>Version Control, Git and Github</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>January 18th, 2015</h4>

     Version Control is, well, pretty cool. In a nutshell, it helps you keep track of your work, enables you to go back in time, and also facilitates collaboration with others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git, along with Subversion, is one of the more popular version control tools. It resides on your local computer, and as you make changes within a git-managed directory, you can check to see that it's monitoring by typing 'git status'. By adding (git add), committing (git commit -m "message"), and then pushing it out to GitHub (git push origin master), it not only records different states (versions) of your work, but it also syncs your work with a central online repository called GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub is pretty cool too. It's like a central cloud storage system where different users from all over the world are able to sync their local Git repos to the main central GitHub repo. Sort of similar to a DropBox concept, GitHub allows your work to be saved in the cloud, and it allows for multiple users to collaborate on the same software in realtime, by managing changes and making sure all parties are synced up.
