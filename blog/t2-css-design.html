    <h4>Classes & ID's<br>January 30th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
  Classes and ID's provide a way to manipulate our html and css code more efficiently than would be the case without using them. Actually, it would be nearly impossible to complete certain basic tasks without using Classes & Id's.
    </p>
    <p>
  They can be thought of as "hooks" in a way, but Classes and ID's are very different types of hooks. Each element can only have one ID, whereas multiple elements can have the same class.
    </p>
    <p>
  This allows us to do very specific and isolated things with ID's, and allows us to perform collective group actions with Classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example below shows the same class name being used for multiple divs:</p>

    <img id="firstimage" src="../imgs/class-widget.png">
    <p>
      Another cool thing you can do with ID's (but not with classes) is that you can actually use them in a URL address to search that page for a particular ID. For example, below this paragraph is a line that reads "Example: this is the example". At the start of that example sentence, within the html code, I've indicated that the ID for that paragraph is "example." And if you add # and the ID to the URL, the page will automatically scroll down to that ID location. Feel free to try. In the above URL on this page, add the following: #example (like so: http://peterhinners.github.io/blog/t2-css-design.html#example). Depending on where you are on the page, you should see the page scroll down to this example sentence below.</p>

    <p id="example">
      Example: this is the example. If you added #example to the above URL the page should take you here.
    </p>
    <p>Pretty nifty, huh? That is something you can do with an ID but not a class.
