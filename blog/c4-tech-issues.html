    <h4>The Non-Threat of Developer Offshoring<br>March 1st, 2015</h4>
    <p>It's not a new phenomenon, it's been around for decades, yet some still consider offshoring to be a threat to America's home-grown developers. Is the threat warranted?
</p>
    <p>As an IT recruiter for the last few years, I've seen foreign developers come here on H1B visas, and I've also seen companies host their own offshore divisions overseas. For someone like myself entering the IT world as a developer, the thought of a future boom in offshoring does give pause for thought. At least at first.

    </p>

    <p>But for a few different reasons, new developers entering this industry for the first time generally feel safe in their career choice, the threat of offshoring notwithstanding.</p>

    <p>The distinction should be probably be made between  offshoring in general, and the offshoring of developers in particular, the latter representing a more niche skillset.</p>

    <p>As regards the offshoring of developers, well, it's not always an inexpensive endeavor, and to date, most of the major offshoring has taken place at the hands of behemoth companies who can afford this option. Economies of scale do not generally favor the small or even medium-size company that wants to offshore a portion of their IT work.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, there is evidence that large companies who do outsource developers do so at their own peril. Turnaround time, communication, and synergy (to name a few) tend to suffer in an offshore situation, and can ultimately cost the company more money in the long run.</p>

    <p>It's almost not even worth mentioning that there are of course excellent developers on both sides of the pond, but in spite of excellent cross-global communication systems now in place, there is just no subsitute for the in-house human factor that a local developer represents.</p>
