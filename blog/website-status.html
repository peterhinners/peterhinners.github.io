    <h4>Blog Status<br>April 5th, 2015</h4>
    
    <p>Just a quick blog about the process of making this blog :-)
    </p>

    

    

<p>Making this website/blog has been both fun and challenging. It's been fun to see it evolve, and it's been challenging implementing CSS and HTML, concepts that were completely foreign to me only 9 weeks ago.
</p>


<p>Between the two, CSS takes the cup as far as being the more difficult of the two, in my opinion. I'm still learning the intricacies of positioning, not to mention having CSS commands affect only a particular portion of a site. </p>




<p>I'm happy with the overall clean and minimalist feel of the site, that was an original goal that I was shooting for. It's been good to build out the blog section of this website, and I'm looking forward to filling out the About, Projects, and Contact portions as I progress through DBC. I'll be looking to keep those sections stylistically inline with this blog section. </p>
