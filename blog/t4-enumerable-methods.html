    <p>What to do when you want to change each individual element in an array? Maybe a 'for' loop? Well, a 'for' loop does change each element, but it also modifies the existing array. But how about those times when we don't want to actually change the existing array?
</p>
    <p>Enter #map. #map, also known affectionately as #collect, allows us to iterate over each individual element in the array without modifying the original array. For example:</p>
