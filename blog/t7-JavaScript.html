    <h4>JavaScript vs Ruby<br>March 23rd, 2015</h4>
    <p>JavaScript and Ruby have some definite similarities, but also some definite differences. Here is a random list of some of them...
</p>
    <p>Syntax differences come to mind first. For example, in JavaScript you generally need a semicolon to end statements (not functions). Also, with "if statements" in Javascript, you need to put the conditional statement within parentheses, unlike Ruby. Printing to the screen is also different... In Ruby you generally use "puts" or "print", whereas with JavaScript you typically use "console.log".
    </p>

    

    

<p>Looping operations are another area that have both differences and similarities. Both Ruby and Javascript have "while loops, that continue to perform until the condition is satisfied. Ruby and Javascript both have "for" loops as well, though the difference widens at that point. In JavaScript, there are only two main types of loops, the "for" and the "while" loops. Ruby offers many more built-in iterating options than JavaScript. For example, you have #each, #map, #select, #inject, #reject and #detect. To achieve these equivalent operations in JavaScript, you would generally begin with a "for" loop in each scenario, and fine tune subsequent actions within the code block.</p>


<p>Both JavaScript and Ruby naturally have different variable scope for different situations as well. In general, like Ruby, anything defined outside a particular function (or method in Ruby) can be accessed from within a function, unless otherwise intended.</p>




<p>In general, while both are high level programming languages (as opposed to low level), Ruby has the reputation of being more programmer friendly. Javascript, though, is arguably <em>the</em> language of the web, and as such is indispensible for being able to manipulate web pages. Both are powerful in their own right. </p>
