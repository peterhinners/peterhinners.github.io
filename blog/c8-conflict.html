    <h4>Conflict<br>March 29th, 2015</h4>
    
    <p>This blog is about conflict in general, how it affects us, and how we react to it. I will use a little personal example.
    </p>

    

    

<p>So this very nice relative of mine did not have any transportation options a while back. Her car broke down, and it would have cost her several thousand to repair it, which was more than the car itself was worth at that time.
</p>


<p>My wife and I are blessed to have two cars, and at the time we were only using one of them on a daily basis, so we offered to let her borrow our other car. Everything went without a hitch for the first month. </p>




<p>Almost like clockwork, at the beginning of the second month of this routine, we got a call from her one morning saying that one of the tires had exploded while she was driving. She was ok, but the car now needed another tire. </p>

<p> No big deal we thought, and we were glad she was ok. We took our car in to the tire shop, and it turned out the damage was more significant than we thought. Ended up costing $1000 to repair.</p>

<p> We were not exactly sure how to react to the whole thing actually, because the assessment of the damage and the story of what actually happened didn't correlate very well. In fact, in all probability, the original story we were told was not the truth. We'll never know for sure, but that's what the evidence points to.</p>

<p> So that is an example of when we experienced conflict. It was a little aggravating, but actually not that big of a deal in the scheme of things. We even decided to let her continue to borrow the car again temporarily until she was able to get a new car. Why? We figured the chances of the same thing happening twice were very small, but the chances of a awkward family fall-out were pretty significant if we decided to withold the car from her. And she did end up getting a new car only a week later or so.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of this super exciting story is that sometimes it's good to take one for the team for the sake of the greater good. Also, to not let potential feelings of anger or resentment alter your perspective. </p>
