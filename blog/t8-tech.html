    <h4>Rails<br>March 29th, 2015</h4>
    <p>As the creator of Ruby puts it, Rails "is the killer app for Ruby." It is essentially a very powerful Ruby framework.
</p>
    <p>David Hansson created Ruby on Rails in 2003 as open source software. A mere three years later Apple stated it would include Rails with the release of OS X Leopard. Rail's popularity and traction have increased exponentially since then.
    </p>

    

    

<p>One of Rails' claim to fame is that it dramatically lowers the entry barrier for web development. Well acclaimed programmers across the board tend to converge on this point. James Duncan Davidson, creator of Tomcat and Ant, puts it this way: “Rails is the most well thought-out web development framework I’ve ever used. And that’s in a decade of doing web applications for a living. I’ve built my own frameworks, helped develop the Servlet API, and have created more than a few web servers from scratch. Nobody has done it like this before.”</p>


<p>Others are still more colorful in their opinion of Rails: “Ruby on Rails is astounding. Using it is like watching a kung-fu movie, where a dozen bad-a$$ frameworks prepare to beat up the little newcomer only to be handed their a$$es in a variety of imaginative ways.” -- Nathan Torkington, O’Reilly Program Chair for OSCON.</p>






<p>I am looking forward to getting to know this framework well. I am also happy that we've started with a good grounding of Ruby, rather than dive right in to Rails. </p>
