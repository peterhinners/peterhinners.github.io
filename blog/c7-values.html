    <h4>Persistent Gratitude<br>March 23rd, 2015</h4>
    
    <p>When I think about the values that will help DBC students weather the oncoming immersion experience, I'm hardpressed to come up with more important ones than persistence and gratitude...
    </p>

    

    

<p>Persistence is a popular underdog value for good reason: it opens doors that wouldn't otherwise open. A million catch-phrases and famous quotes exist on the topic, and we could probably use a million more to remind us of persistence's virtues. Many of the phrases and quotes amount to this... It doesn't matter if we fall down. Falling down is not failure. In fact, falling down is essential for forward movement and progress. Not falling down indicates that we're stagnating. It's the getting up part where persistence comes in to play. And as long as we keep getting up, we're not failing, we're going through the necessary path of trial and error -- nature's great feedback mechanism -- to reach our goal.

<p>Another value also popular but less widely held is that of gratitude. Being thankful for what we do have helps us in many ways. It keeps us focused on what we have, as opposed to what we don't have. That alone fosters a positive outlook. It reminds us to count our blessings and take stock of how good (God || The Universe || Life) has really been to us. There is much to be thankful for, on a daily basis, and there are always people who have it worse off than we do. Even those people objectively worse off than ourselves can be examples to us in the measure of their own gratitude.</p>




<p>Developers, or programmer types, are typically wired to look for errors in things. This is not a sadistic tendency, but one that in theory allows for quicker resolution and a better final product. This tendency we have carries over into our everyday lives of course, and in this area we would do well to exercise some moderation. Objectively, the glass <em>is</em> half empty, but it is also, <em>every bit as much</em>, half full.  </p>
