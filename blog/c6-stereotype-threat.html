    <h4>Stereotype Threat<br>March 15th, 2015</h4>
    <p>The term stereotype threat was coined by Dr. Claude Steele and basically means that when an individual is placed in a situation in which they are conscious of a negative stereotype about themselves, their actual performance tends to mirror that stereotype in a sort of self-fulfilling prophesy.
</p>
    <p>This is an interesting discovery, and one that parallels what many mystic and religious thinkers have said throughout the centuries: namely, that what one fears, one brings upon themself. Some refer to this as the law of attraction. Since much of our thought involves words, it's worth noting the importance our inner words have in bringing this law to light. For example, we've all heard it said, "If I tell you, 'Don't think of a purple elephant!'", it's mighty hard not to actually think of one, even for a brief moment. They say it's more effective, whether in thought or speech, to focus on what you do hope to gravitate towards, rather than phrasing in the negative what you don't want to think about/do/feel, etc.
    </p>
    

    

<p>I suppose that as a 37 year old white male, the main negative stereotype I'll have to avoid is that of being a bit old to get started on this developer path. I guess I hadn't actually really thought about it much until this assignment, actually (dang it all! ;-) And I imagine the best medicine for this sort of thing is to continually think of myself as a young fella. So, in that vein, I think it's time to go grab a beer :-)
