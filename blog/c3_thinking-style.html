    <h4>Thinking Styles<br>February 1st, 2015</h4>
    <p>
A little reflection on my thinking style, as measured by Anthony Gregorc's Mind Styles test... </p>

<p>My predominant thinking style is categorized as "Abstract Sequential", which for the lay-person can be roughly translated as intolerable son-of-a-gun.</p>

<p>More specifically, we of the Abstract Sequential ilk love the world of theory and abstract thought. We tend to analyze a situation fully before making a decision, preferrably using logic while reaching that decision. It is usually difficult for us to work on something with what we deem is too little time to thoroughly examine/investigate the situation. </p>
<p>
  In the name of a "fixed" versus "growth" mindset, and the ability to truly grow as a person and developer, it will be important for all of us to use our thinking styles to our advantage. This will probably entail maximizing the positives, minimizing the negatives, and being willing to wear other thinking style hats in this (sometimes painful) growth process.</p>
