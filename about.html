    <p>Life is good. I'm just starting to realize that.  
    </p>
    <p>You remember the last time you dreamt about code? It happens to me a lot these days. It makes you realize that: (a), you are a nerd, and (b), you've got syntax actually coursing through your veins now. I've never felt more alive.  </p>

    <p>I'm a recent grad of <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" class="blue" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>. That's the place that started the immersive developer bootcamp concept. To date they've graduated more than 1,500 nerds and syntax junkies.</p>

    <p>They call it "bootcamp" for good reason. 80 hour weeks. 19 to 25 week curriculum. Assessments aplenty, and very little sleep. When you finish, they actually give you military-style dog tags to remember your journey.</p>

    <p>The focus is on Ruby, Javascript, common Javascript libraries, Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML and CSS, as well as pair programming, agile and test driven development, object oriented programming and algorithmic thinking. Git/Github are utilized every day. </p>

    <p>It's a lot.</p>

    <p>But somehow you make it through. And then something starts to happen.</p>

    <p>You just get... happy. Maybe because you realize how fortunate you are. How many people do you know that honestly love what they do? Software development is a lifestyle, not just a career. That's something we've already tasted. It's empowering, and it fosters creation. In some sense, software developers are like modern day craftsmen. What a privilege to be able to make beautiful and meaningful things that have real-world impact.</p>
