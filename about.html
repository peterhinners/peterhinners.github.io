    <p>Life is good. I'm just starting to realize that.  
    </p>
    <p>You remember the last time you dreamt about code? It happens to me a lot these days. It makes you realize that: (a), you are a nerd, and (b), you've got syntax actually coursing through your veins now. I've never felt more alive.  </p>

    <p>I'm a recent grad of Dev Bootcamp. That's the place that started the immersive developer bootcamp concept. You may have read about them. To date they've graduated more than 1,000 nerds and syntax junkies.</p>

    <p>It's not an easy experience. 80 hour weeks. 19 to 25 week curriculum. Less than a 10th of initial applicants make it through to graduation, and some are asked to leave due to insufficiently high assessment scores (happened to two of my friends there, very sad). Suuuuuper stressful. To give you an idea of the level of stress, they have an onsite professional psychologist there to help students cope with everything.</p>

    <p>The focus is on Ruby, Javascript, common Javascript libraries, Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML and CSS, as well as pair programming, agile and test driven development, object oriented programming as well as algorithms. Git/Github are utilized every day. </p>

    <p>It's a lot.</p>

    <p>But somehow you make it through. And then something starts to happen.</p>

    <p>You just get... happy. I think it's because you realize how fortunate you are. How many people do you know that honestly love what they do? Software development is a lifestyle, not just a career. That's something we've already tasted. It's empowering, and its methods and means foster creation. In some sense, we're like modern day craftsmen, creating these beautiful and intricate structures laid atop foundations of logic. Like modern masons in a way.</p>

    <p>All these things I share with my fellow Dev Bootcamp grads.</p>
    <p>So what makes me unique? Well, like most people, I am many things. To sum it up in one, long (run-on) sentence, it might be this: </p>
    <p>I am a language loving (speak fluent Spanish at home with my wife & good conversational German), music aficionado (grew up playing classical piano, mostly Bach), </p>
